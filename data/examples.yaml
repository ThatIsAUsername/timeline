# List of timeline records
# Possible fields for each entry:
#
# name (required)
# id (optional - used for cross-referencing)
# start
# end
# start_before
# start_after
# end_before
# end_after
# duration (in years/months/days, formatted as "#y #m #d", in any order, e.g. "5d 3m 1y")
# info (one or more strings)
#
# Most fields can accept either a date or another event's ID (plus optional offset).
# Dates are formatted as "[day] [mon] year"
# IDs are strings, and simply need to match the "id" field of another record.
# Fields given an ID may also take a temporal offset, formatted "[+-] #y #m #d", in any order, e.g. "+ 5d 3m 1y"
# Entry IDs may also be augmented by ^/$ to refer specifically to the beginning (^rec) or end (rec$) of that entry.
#
# E.g given two events, A and B:
# name: A
# end_before: B       # Event A ends before event B begins
# end_before: ^B      # Event A ends before event B begins
# end_before: B$      # Event A ends before event B ends (but not necessarily after it begins)
# end: ^B             # Event A ends when event B begins
# end: B$             # Event A ends when event B ends
# end: B              # Event A ends sometime during event B
# end_after: ^B       # Event A ends after event B begins  (but not necessarily before it ends)
# end_after: B        # Event A ends after event B ends
# end_after: B$       # Event A ends after event B ends
# duration: 1y 3m 2d  # Event A lasts for 1 year, 3 months, and 2 days. Can include any/all units.
                      # Durations are as precise as specified; e.g. "1y" means at least 1 year, but less than 2.
# end: B - 1y 2m      # Event A ends 1 year and 2 months before event B begins.
# end: B$ - 1y 2m     # Event A ends 1 year and 2 months before event B ends.
# end: B + 1y 2m      # Event A ends 1 year and 2 months after event B ends.
