# List of timeline records
# Possible fields for each entry:
#
# name (required)
# id (optional - used for cross-referencing)
# start (formatted as [day] [MON] Year)
# end (formatted as [day] [MON] Year)
# start_before (date or other event)

# end_before (date or other event)

# The start*/end* tags can accept ids of other entries within this file, augmented by ^/& modifiers.
# E.g given two events, A and B:
# name: A
# end_before: B   # Event A ends before event B begins
# end_before: ^B  # Event A ends before event B begins
# end_before: B&  # Event A ends before event B ends (but not necessarily after it begins)
# end: ^B         # Event A ends when event B begins
# end: B&         # Event A ends when event B ends
# end: B          # Event A ends sometime during event B
# end_after: ^B   # Event A ends after event B begins  (but not necessarily before it ends)
# end_after: B    # Event A ends after event B ends
# end_after: B&   # Event A ends after event B ends
